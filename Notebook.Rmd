# Background

I will be re-factoring the original USRDS project to make it simpler and more efficient to use in 
R. The main improvements planned are:

1. Incorporating data into SQLite and MonetDB databases for easier data munging
2. Improving computation by incorporating more recent developments in competing risks modeling

# Updates

### June 27, 2017
I created a script (`data/verifyPaths.r`) that automatically captures the database directory from 
the external disk label. The databases are on one of two external HDs. Backups of the raw data are on the P: drive.

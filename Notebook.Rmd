# Background

I will be re-factoring the original USRDS project to make it simpler and more efficient to use in 
R. The main improvements planned are:

1. Incorporating data into SQLite and MonetDB databases for easier data munging
2. Improving computation by incorporating more recent developments in competing risks modeling

# Software

I'm putting all the datasets in on-disk SQL-based storage, using 
SQLite and MonetDB. The latter is a bit more finicky to set up but 
is quite a bit quicker for the datasets. MonetDB is installed and used 
through the `MonetDBLite` R package. SQLite is installed and used through the `RSQLite` R package. 

There may be value to doing data manipulation in Spark, even on a local Spark instance, given the sizes of the data sets. The rate-limiting 
factor may be copying the data sets into Spark. However, the munging and descriptives might be much faster. 

The current plan (6/29/17) is to do select and join functions in the SQL
databases, import those into R, and then do mutate and distinct operations. These can possibly be exported into Spark with much lower 
overhead on memory operationally.

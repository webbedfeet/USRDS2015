title: "Simulating discontinuation to replicate one group experience"
description: |
  We want to simulate data for different ethnic groups that reflects the dialysis discontinuation
  experience of White patients, so that we can see how much the survival patterns in these groups 
  is affected by imposing a different discontinuation pattern on them, and whether that discontinuation
  pattern significantly affects the resultant simulated survival and changes qualitative findings.

# Introduction to the problem

We believe that one of the primary drivers of survival disparities among dialysis patients is a 
differential propensity to voluntarily discontinue dialysis. Our data provides evidence that discontinuation
rates are higher (or, time from first dialysis to discontinuation is shorter) among whites than other 
ethnic groups, even accounting for socio-economic status.
